### julia meme machine

This has nothing to do with the Julia language.

Relatively simple script for making standard two line memes. Inspired by my friend (frenemy?) Julia (hence the name) and her loathing of the pic we used for a meme of here. When she demanded I delete the picture, I responded by making this so I could make all her pictures into memes more efficiently.

This is also why the base use case with no arguments assumes you want "I can look into your eyes and tell that you're lying" as your meme text. It's a thing she said once.

(I might make this better eventually, right now it just has one annoyingly inflexible use case)
