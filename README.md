## julia meme machine

Relatively simple script for making standard two line memes. It was inspired by my friend Julia (hence the name) and her loathing of the picture of her we used for a meme. When she demanded I delete the picture, I responded by making this so I could make all her pictures into memes more efficently.

This is also why the base use case with no arguments assumes you want "I can look into your eyes and tell that you're lying" as your meme text. It's a thing she said once.
